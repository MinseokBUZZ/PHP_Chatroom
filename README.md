# PHP_Chatroom
## PHP Final Project 

### PHP_Chatroom
** The purpose of this project is to design and create a chat room and to integrate PHP and JavaScript that I have learned already. This project consists of 
✓ User interface with HTML, CSS, 
✓ JavaScript, 
✓ Database, and 
✓ PHP scripts.

### Joining the room
The user joins the chatroom providing a username. Duplication verification is done using “AUTO_INCREMENT” to ensure that the user id is not already taken. Once the user is authenticated, the chat room functionality is made available, and a session is opened for that user.

### Chatroom Functionality
There is chat room (form) to write your message. The form submits messages to a server. The messages is stored in a MySQL database on the server. A PHP script accepts the messages on the server side and enter them in the database as well as retrieve messages from the db.
